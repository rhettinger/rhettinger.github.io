Depth First and Breadth First Search
===================================

Overview
--------

A number of puzzles can be solved by either depth first search
or breadth first search.

Both are easy to implement using ``collections.deque()``.

Generic Puzzle Solver
---------------------

Here I present a generic puzzle solver that works
on a broad class of puzzles.

The core idea is that we need very few things to describe
the puzzle in a way that a solver can find a solution:

1) We need an initial position (the unsolved puzzle)
2) We need a rule (typically an iterator) to generate
   all possible moves from a position.
3) We need to recognize the goal state.

Optionally, we can provide some extras:

4) A nice ``__repr__`` method to display the puzzle
   position in a way recognizable to us.
5) A way to recognize that some positions are
   considered to be equivalent and don't need
   to be explored twice (i.e. in tic-tac-toe,
   all four corner opening moves essentially
   describe the same).


Jug Filling Problem
-------------------

**Problem statement:**
"Given a two empty jugs with 3 and 5 liter capacities and a full
jug with 8 liters, find a sequence of pours leaving four liters
in the two largest jugs."

How to code it:

.. literalinclude:: code/jug_fill.py

How a puzzle instance works::

        >>> from pprint import pprint
        >>> from jug_fill import JugFill
        >>> p = JugFill()                # Make a fresh puzzle
        >>> print(p)                     # Display the current position
        (0, 0, 8)
        >>> p.isgoal()                   # Are we at the goal state?
        False
        >>> for move in p:               # Display possible moves
        ...     print(move)
        ...
        (3, 0, 5)
        (0, 5, 3)

Running the *solve()* method immediately generates a solution::

        [(0, 0, 8),
         (0, 5, 3),
         (3, 2, 3),
         (0, 2, 6),
         (2, 0, 6),
         (2, 5, 1),
         (3, 4, 1),
         (0, 4, 4)]


Sliding Block Puzzle
--------------------

**Problem statement:**
"Slide blocks within a fixed grid so that the largest block
ends-up in the lower left corner."

Output::

Core Logic
----------

The only essential Python tool you need is ``collections.deque()``,
the double ended queue.

For a breadth first search, we *pop* an unexplored positions off
of a deque.  For each position, we generate the next possible
moves and *prepend* them to the deque of unexplored move.

For a depth first search, we *append* rather than prepend.

To make it possible to replay the sequence of moves,
we keep a *trail* dictionary that maps each move to
its predecessor.

As an optimization, we call an optional user supplied
*canonical()* method to see if the current position
is equivalent to one that we've already explored.

::

    def solve(pos, depthFirst=False):
        queue = deque([pos])
        trail = {intern(pos.canonical()): None}
        solution = deque()
        load = queue.append if depthFirst else queue.appendleft

        while not pos.isgoal():
            for m in pos:
                c = m.canonical()
                if c in trail:
                    continue
                trail[intern(c)] = pos
                load(m)
            pos = queue.pop()

        while pos:
            solution.appendleft(pos)
            pos = trail[pos.canonical()]

        return list(solution)
